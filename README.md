# High-Contrast-Theme-Creator
It makes uglies

## PLEASE READ
Works with **AHK_H** (https://hotkeyit.github.io/v2/) **only** because I decided to have the tall GUI scrollable. Simple changes can be made to undo that, but I'm not going to.

------
Main file:
Theme10.ahk - Run this.
TestGUI.ahk - When a theme is applied, you can run this to see how most common controls will look

------
## HOW IT wiLL LOOK
Not all windows will look the same. Many programs theme stff differently, or override defaults. So like all High Contrast themes, it'll probably look ugly on some/most windows. Don't blame me. Also, this was **made for Windows 10**. The created themes may or may not work on older OS's.

Since this was made for and tested only on Windows 10, I cannot/did not test if it works with Classic Theme *(the Windows 98 look)*. If it does, you'll probably have access to more of the colors. High Contrast only uses a handful of the available colors.

... Screenshots to be added ...
